    ##   - default - in our own code till they are fixed (we can see what we
    ##     need to fix, but builds don't break)
    ##   - ignore - in other's code (no noise please, clean ours first)
    ## * Clean:
    ##   - error - in our own code (don't regress)
    ##   - default - in other's code if they are not fixed.  Be specific about
    ##     what module so we don't allow other brokenness in (able to watch
    ##     others fixing their code, don't hide it)
    ##   - error - if we have no occurances in our's or other's code (keep it
    ##     clean - should essentially not be listed and falls to default error
    ##     behaviour)
